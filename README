NAME
    Catalyst::ActionRole::PseudoCache - Super simple caching for Catalyst
    actions

VERSION
    version 0.093200

SYNOPSIS
     package MyApp::Controller::Root;
    our $VERSION = '0.093200';



     use Moose;
     BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' };

     sub all_js :Local :Does(PseudoCache) PCUrl(/static/js/all.js) {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;
        # Long running action to be cached
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module was originally made to take the output of
    Catalyst::View::JavaScript::Minifier::XS and store it in a file so that
    after the server booted we would not need to generate it again and could
    let the static web server serve up the static file. Obviously it can be
    used for much more than javascript, but it's mostly made with large,
    purely javascript sites in mind. It does not cache the output of the
    action when the server is run in development mode.

ATTRIBUTES
  PCUrl
    Required.

    After the action runs once it will redirect to $PCUrl.

  PCPath
    When the action gets run the first time it will write it's output to
    $PCPath.

    Defaults to "$c-"path_to('root') . $PCUrl>

    So using the example given above for the "all_js" action, the path will
    be

     $MyAppLocation/root/static/js/all.js
